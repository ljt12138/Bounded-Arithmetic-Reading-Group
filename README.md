# Bounded Arithmetic Reading Group (2024 Fall)

Bounded arithmetic is a collective name of fragments of Peano arithmetic that are closely related to complexity classes, such as P, PH, and L. The study of bounded theories is relevant to the program of showing unprovability of complexity conjectures; moreover, the techniques developed in this field are found useful in recent development of complexity theory and cryptography. In this reading group, we will learn basics of bounded arithmetic from scratch (without assuming backgrounds in logic). 

This GitHub repository is for storing the reading materials and the notes taken in the reading group.
